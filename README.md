# PRESTIGE-ROBLOX
A Byfron bypass using memory modifications with *Pymem*.
This uses the same method as Netflix CE. Works with any teleporter game But I use
[**This**](https://www.roblox.com/games/16138148062/) game for the teleport.
Prestige also supports more game than normal tool less executor since this scans through the entire descendants of Workspace.
